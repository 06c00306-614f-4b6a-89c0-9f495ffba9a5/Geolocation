## About the project
- Created this application since I wanted to have a gui for geolocating devices
- I intially got the idea from a cool project called seeker but they lacked gui.
- You will see the code I wrote takes a completely different approach and is very useful.
- Do not use this gui for illegal purposes, it was created for educational purposes.
- I will develop this app even more when I have time, should be fully functional as is.
- Drop star on this repository if you want more tools to be created.
